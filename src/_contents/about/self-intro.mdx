Hi, I'm Lin-Ning Kung, a master's student at Brown University majoring in Computer Science, with a passion for Full-Stack Development and Software Engineering. I thrive in building scalable and maintainable software solutions, from conceptual design to deployment, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at MOXA, where I specialized in automation testing and continuous integration. I developed a robust automation framework, implemented double buffering algorithms for hardware simulation, and optimized CI/CD pipelines using Docker, Jenkins, and GitLab. My work led to a 30% increase in test coverage and significantly reduced software release cycles.

Beyond my technical expertise, I love exploring new gadgets and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in cloud computing, DevOps, and AI-powered development. My current interests include building intelligent and automated software solutions that improve productivity and user interactions.
