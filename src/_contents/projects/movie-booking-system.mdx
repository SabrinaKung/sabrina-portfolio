> Movie Booking System
> This is a movie booking system built using movie data from Ambassador Theatres. The ticketing website recommends movie genres based on the user's selected mood and displays currently available movies for selection. Users can freely choose a movie, theater, and date/time to book their tickets. Additionally, after booking, users can enter their information to request a ticket refund.
